# cs110-professional-website

For this project, you will create a portfolio website that will professionally showcase your
resume. Your website should include the core elements of a traditional resume but needs to be
presented in a way that grabs and keeps the attention of the user. Clarity and organization are
key; visitors should be able to know who you are, what you do, and how to contact you within
seconds of opening the page
